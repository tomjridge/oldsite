OK, a true story

  * A couple of years ago, I wanted to try out some new ideas I had for
implementing file system. 

  * Up to that point, I'd been a user of file systems and I felt I
  sort-of knew how they were supposed to behave. I knew a little bit
  about permissions, but if you asked me about what permissions mean
  on directories I would probably have got it wrong.

  * Anyway, I sat down
  and fairly soon I had something that sort-of worked. There was a
  tree of directories, and files that you could read and write data
  to. 

  * Then I started to fill in the details. I started with
  rename. What happens if the src of the rename doesn't exist? I wrote
  a little program to check, and found it raised the error ENOENT -
  "Error, no entity" - which makes sense. What happens when you rename
  a file onto a directory? EISDIR - "Error is directory" which again
  made sense.  

  * I was aware that I was just testing a particular  filesystem (ext on Linux).

  * Explosion of test cases, Writing tests for each particular
  scenario becomes boring pretty quickly.

  * What I needed was a specification that
  told me what was supposed to happen. I looked on the web at places
  like Stackoverflow, and saw that there were quite a few questions
  about file system behaviour, and this was helpful, but the
  information was dispersed, and piecemeal - there wasn't any
  organization, information was outdated and sometimes it would take
  hours of seaching to discover that some particular behaviour was a
  known issue with a particular file system.

I was aware of some documentation such as
man pages, and the gnu libc documentation, and at some point I became
aware of the POSIX spec. This was a huge collection of html pages
describing how various libc functions were supposed to behave. For
example, the page for open is here...

Hopeful. This seemed to be just what I was looking for: a specification of how
file systems were supposed to behave. 

They've put a lot of effort into it.

OK, it was very large (and humans can't deal with this amount of
information), but perhaps I could just read the pages I was interested
in. Unfortunately this was a non-starter - things like path resolution
are spread throughout POSIX.

I also began to worry that the POSIX specification, whilst mostly
comprehensible, was unclear in places, and it took lots of
cross-checking, and emails to the mailing list, to figure out what was
supposed to be going on. For example, O_CREAT | O_DIRECTORY (other
clauses elsewhere interfere)

My brain is not good at detail, and as
time went on, the accumulation of detail was overwhelming.

I also realized that existing systems, such as Linux, are only mostly
compliant with POSIX. Mac claims to be POSIX, but is it really? Linux
doesn't even claim to be POSIX compliant. So if I wanted to really
understand what was going on, I'd have to remember details of Linux,
Mac and FreeBSD. In fact, it was even worse than this because
individual file systems might behave differently too.

preface: lots of source of info

what file systems actually do: can do some searching on the web, find obscure bug reports

none of the sources is synced with each other; bug reports can be hard to find;

real-world: can write test cases, but they can only tell you so much

FIXME text?

so I set out to try and write a specification of file systems that
satisfied all the items on the wishlist; I thought it would take about
6 months; it actually took about 3 years

formal languages are languages machines can understand; it is hard to
write a specification that is precise etc without using a formal
language; if you want to use the specification to directly test
real-world implementations, you have to use a formal language

    <li>Implementation error codes are quite often non-POSIX (and the SibylFS spec tells you exactly what these deviations are)</li>

    <li>Path resolution, particularly when a trailing slash is involved, is variable, non-POSIX</li>

    <li>Treatment of paths referencing symlinks, particularly when the path ends in a trailing slash, is highly variable</li>

    <li>Various overlay filesystems, and FUSE filesystems, mess up things like permissions</li>

    <li>posixovl/VFAT (posix emulation on top of VFAT) gets link count wrong when rename overwrites a file that is linked elsewhere; possible to get to a state where the filesystem contains no files, but there is no free space (space leak)</li>

    <li>OpenZFS on Linux 3.13.0-34 (Ubuntu Trusty): files opened with O_APPEND would not seek to the end of the file before write or pwrite (probably causing applications that use this functionality to fail)</li>

    <li>OpenZFS on OS/X: possible to execute a sequence of calls which leads to the calling process hanging using 100% CPU, unresponsive to signals; volume cannot be unmounted, machine cannot be shut down; force unmounting may cause storage device to become unusable until next system restart</li>

    <li>Permissions: the Linux implementation of permissions should give the same behaviour from one kernel version to the next; however, we found test scripts involving file and directory access that failed on Linux kernel 3.13 and succeeded on 3.14 which we believe is due to a buggy 3.13 implementation of permissions in edge cases</li>
