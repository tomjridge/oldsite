<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the home page of Tom Ridge. I am an academic researcher in computer science, programmer, and senior lecturer. I am currently at the University of Leicester, UK. Previously I was at the University of Cambridge.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>A brief résumé:</p>
<ul>
<li>My undergraduate degree is in mathematics from Trinity College, University of Cambridge, where I also did the Diploma in Computer Science (somewhat similar to a Master’s degree).</li>
<li>I have a senior scholarship from Trinity College listed <a href="http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/1999-2000/weekly/5787/22.html">here</a>, which I only found out about many years after it was awarded.</li>
<li>After the diploma I spent a couple of years in the City of London. I was paid much more than I earn now, even though it was my first real job!</li>
<li>I did my PhD at the Laboratory for the Foundations of Computer Science, University of Edinburgh. My supervisor was Paul Jackson.</li>
<li>I was then a researcher at the Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge. I was mainly supervised by Peter Sewell (NetSem TCP/IP project, and later weak memory models), but for the last year I was supervised by Matthew Parkinson (weak memory models, again).</li>
<li>I have been at Leicester since September 2009.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bio-for-conferences">Bio (for conferences)</h2>
<p>Tom Ridge is a Senior Lecturer at the University of Leicester. His background is in formal methods. His research has mainly focused on applications of formal methods to real-world systems. He worked at Cambridge on the NetSem project giving a formal semantics to TCP/IP, and then briefly worked on relaxed memory models. Recently he has worked on verified parsing, and the semantics of file systems.</p>
